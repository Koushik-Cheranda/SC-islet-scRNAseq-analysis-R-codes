# SC-islet-scRNAseq-analysis-R-codes
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis of mature stem cell-derived islets was conducted utilizing the established Seurat workflow. Initially, CellRanger outputs were processed to eliminate ambient RNA and doublets. The filtered datasets were then normalized and variance-stabilized before proceeding with clustering and integration. Subsequent downstream analyses and figure generation were performed using the processed Seurat object file.

R codes used in this project are in the followiung order:

1_SoupX_codes
2_DoubletFinder_codes
3_Seurat_codes
4_Alpha_Beta_codes
5_Figures_codes
